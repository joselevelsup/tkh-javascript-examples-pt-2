# Express Practice

## Setup

- Make sure to install the node modules. In this folder, run `npm install`. The dependencies needed to run this app, is already listed in the `package.json`
- To run the app to make sure everything is working, (in your terminal) run `node app.js`. If you want to go the extra mile, you can add a script to the package.json scripts object.
  - Call the key `start` then for the value set it to `node app.js`.
  - So it would look like:
  ```json
  //package.json
  "script": {
    "start": "node app.js"
  }
  ```
  - Now you can just run `npm run start`
